# Python-and-SQL-practise
A small program I made while at my software dev bootcamp

This is a program which creates a database, inserts user data into it and can retrieve data.
To run it yourself, it will require an SQL server.
You will also need to create a file called "config.txt" containing the password to your SQL server.
